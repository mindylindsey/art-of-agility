# What is the Difference Between Scrum and Agile?
Agile is a category of software development methodologies that are based on iterative and incremental approaches. The focus is to deliver smaller 
pieces of software functionality in short time periods (or iterations) rather than taking longer periods of time to deliver larger chunks of functionality.

Scrum is an Agile framework created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland. Scrum focuses on development by cross-functional teams that work in time-boxed 
units referred to as sprints. Teams are small and highly adaptive. Multiple scrum teams can work together to deliver functionality for a product.
