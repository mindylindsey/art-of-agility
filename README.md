# About this Book

This book provides information on how teams can transition to an Agile development model or how those teams already working within an Agile framework can make improvements to their processes. The focus on the first book is on Agile Scrum teams, but more books will be added to cover other popular Agile frameworks.

# Why I Wrote This Book?

I had been working as a technical writer for close to 10 years before I started working with my first Agile scrum team. I became a Certified Scrum master so that I could better understand how my technical writing team could work within that model. I have worked with a number of software development and DevOps teams that have adopted Agile processes for more than a decade since that time. There is no "one size fits all" approach to working on an Agile team. However, I find that if your take time to understand the concepts behind Agile and understand that constant evaluations of a teams processes are a critical part of the process, your team will be successful.
