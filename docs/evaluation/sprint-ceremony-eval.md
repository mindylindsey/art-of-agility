# Root Cause Analysis

Improvements can be made at any stage of the Agile sprint from sprint planning to retrospective. With short development cycles of 2-3 weeks, 
Scrum teams have more frequent opportunities to evaluate how the development process is working than they would in a waterfall development 
environment. The team has the opportunity to look at their processes throughout the sprint cycle and at the end of each sprint during the retrospective. 
They can think about how things _could be_ better and make changes _to be_ better. 

Some of the issues that teams might be having are mentioned in the following table as well as references to the section(s) with more information 
on how fix them.
