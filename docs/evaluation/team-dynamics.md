# Impact of Team Dynamics

Changes to requirements are an expected part of the development cycle. Successful Scrum teams adapt to these changes. They must also be willing 
to make changes to their own team processes. Changes are often needed as the team itself changes.

Agile teams are reliant on the team’s ability to work with each other and with product owners. As individuals come into and leave the team, team dynamics 
are impacted. Addressing these changes in team dynamics is critical to continuing function of the team at a high level of efficiency. 

Changes that might be help the team work together might be as simple as adjusting the time of the team’s daily standup. Although standup generally 
occurs first thing in the morning, so that the team understands what they are working on and blocking items can be addressed, you might find that your 
team is more engaged, if the standup starts 30 minutes after the start of the day. This time buffer gives individuals time to get logged in and settled 
before they start talking about work items to the rest of the team. It gets them time to refocus on the tasks at hand.
