# Areas for Process Improvements

Process improvement opportunities can be found in any phase. 

For instance, if software bugs were found, do improvements need to be made to the Testing phase to:

*	Incorporate more rigorous test cases? 
*	Provide longer soak time for new code in the testing environment? 
*	Add resources to provide integration testing with other software products that are part of their product suite? 

Or, are there issues with the Implementation and Coding phase that need to be addresses, such as ensuring that developers follow team coding 
standards and guidelines or implementing more rigorous code reviewing practices.

During this self-evaluation process, teams should not lose sight of what they did right. Were the requirements defined in the Requirements 
Gathering and Analysis well defined and communicated to the architecture and development teams during the Design and Implementations and Coding phases? 
Did automated deployment strategies allow the team to seamlessly deploy new code and eliminate the chances of human error.
