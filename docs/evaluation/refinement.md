# Backlog Refinement

Like sprint planning, backlog refinement is a place to look for issues, if you are finding that your team is not completing all of its user stories each sprint. 
First, consider the quality of your backlog:

*	Does the product owner have the backlog refined with the highest priority tasks at the top?

    The product owner owns the backlog and should be refining it on an ongoing basis, not simply during the backlog refinement meetings. 
    The highest priority items should be at the top of the backlog, as those are the most likely items to be included in the next sprint. 

*	Do the highest priority items have the most amount of detail with respect to detail of the story, acceptance criteria, etc.? 

    During backlog grooming, the team adds any necessary detail to the highest priority items in the backlog. These items are discussed and pointed 
    (if they have not already be pointed during a previous refinement session.) If these high priority stories do not have the correct level of detail, 
    the team runs the risk of delivering functionality that does not meet the needs of the stakeholders and customers.

Next, consider how you are sizing your stories:

*	Do you have a reference story that you are using to size new stories?

    The reference story should be one that the team can use as a basis for the sizing of newer stories. The team must have a clear understanding 
    of the size of the reference story so that team members can determine whether new stories are larger or smaller. Relative sizing generally gets 
    easier as a team has sized a number of stories. However, it is good to review the reference story during each planning meeting to ensure that all 
    team members are using the same basis for their comparisons.

*	Are all of the team members defending their story point estimates when there is a discrepancy?

    Story pointing is a collaborative effort. Each team member should provide their estimate independent of the other members on the team. Discrepancies 
    should be discussed. Team members should feel comfortable defending their position rather than simply succumbing to the majority. Encourage the team 
    to talk about their estimates before coming to a consensus on the number of story points.
