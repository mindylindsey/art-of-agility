# Retrospective

The retrospective is a time to evaluate the sprint and talk about ways to make improvements. It allows you the opportunity to look at all of your 
processes from backlog refinement to sprint planning to managing sprint tasks.

As discussed in a previous chapter, one way of evaluating your processes is to document the activities that you should start, stop, and continue. 
These activities can be anything from starting to pay more attention in daily scrum meetings to stopping taking on new work during the sprint. Once 
the team agrees to that start, stops, and continues, you should post them, so that the team keeps them top of mind as they begin working on the next 
sprint. The scrum master and team should keep each other accountable to the new standards. 

Evaluating how you are handling the start, stop, and continue recommendations that you made in previous retrospectives is a good way to keep the team 
focused on improvements. If the team agreed to stop cancelling the daily standup to allow more time for other work tasks, and yet, daily standups are 
still being cancelled, the team should talk about what they can do to put the focus back on the standups. Can they move the meeting earlier in the day, 
so that it doesnâ€™t disrupt the flow of work? Would the team like to have a little more time in the morning to get started on tasks before taking a break 
to sync up with the team? 

The team is dynamic, so activities that you identified previously as ones that you need to start or stop may no longer apply. However, you can (and should) 
still look at these activities to determine which ones apply and how to best implement improvements to team processes.
