# Measuring Agile Scrum Team Performance

Measuring a team’s performance is important, regardless of the method of the team’s development or the type of product that the team is developing. 
Performance can be measured with a variety of metrics from the speed of product delivery to the quality of the product. 

Quality and speed are both inherently important to Agile development teams, as is indicated by several of the Agile principles:

*	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

*	Working software is the primary measure of progress.

*	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

This chapter describes some of the most common ways to measure the performance of an Agile scrum team.
