# Agile Basics

Agile development is a term that describes a set of development frameworks and practices that are based on the values and principles in a document known as the Agile Manifesto. Although this book focuses on the Scrum framework, it is important to understand the basics of Agile, why it is benefical, and how it compares to the other Agile frameworks. 

The next chapter in this book focuses on Scrum, so if you are already familiar with Agile basics, you can begin with that chapter. If you are new to Agile, continue with chapter that contains information on the following topics:

*	A brief history of the Agile development methodology
*	The Agile Manifesto, values, and principles
*	Advantages of the Agile framework
*	Common myths about Agile
*	A comparison of Scrum and other Agile frameworks
