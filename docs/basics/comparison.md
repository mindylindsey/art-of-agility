# Agile Framework Comparison

The following table provides a brief overview of some of the most common Agile frameworks.

| Framework                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kanban                        | Allows software to be developed into one large development cycle rather than in iterations.  The focus is on continuous delivery.  Changes in the project workload can be made at any time, unlike with Scrum that disallows changes once a sprint has started. Although Kanban does not focus on iterative changes, it does follow the principles established by the Agile manifesto. |
| Lean                          | Applies lean manufacturing principles to software development practices.  Value placed on eliminating waste in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Scaled Agile Framework (SAFE) | Focus on three pillars: team, program, and portfolio. SAFe is designed to give a team flexibility and to help manage some of the challenges larger organizations have when practicing Agile.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Scrum                         | Most popular Agile framework. Focuses on development by cross-functional teams that work in time-boxed units referred to as sprints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| XP                            | Emphasizes the quality of the software as well as the quality of the life of development team. XP is designed for small project teams and focuses on perfecting a small number engineering practices.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
