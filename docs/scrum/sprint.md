# Sprint

A _sprint_ is a defined period of time (or time box) within which a defined amount of work is done. In Scrum, sprints generally last between 2 and 4 weeks. 
The work to be completed in the sprint is defined during the sprint planning meeting on the first day of the sprint. 

The length of your sprints should remain consistent. So, once you determine what sprint length works best for your team, you should stick to it. 
You shouldnâ€™t change the length of the sprint to accommodate the work. You should fit the work into the defined sprint length.
