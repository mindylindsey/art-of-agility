# Understanding Scrum Terminology

Before you focus on how to build and optimize Agile Scrum teams, it is important to understand some basic terminology. 
Although other Agile frameworks use many of the same components, such as sprints and user stories, this section focuses on the use of these components 
in a Scrum environment.

The descriptions in this section are meant to give you a brief overview of some basic terminology. Do not feel that you have to have the definitions 
memorized before continuing on. Each of these terms is described in more detail later in the site, and you can always come back to this section if 
you need a refresher on any of these definitions.
