# Scrum Ceremonies

The scrum ceremonies are meetings that take place during every sprint. Each ceremony is attended by all members of the team and has a defined purpose.
The ceremonies include:

*	Sprint planning
*	Daily standups
*	Backlog refinement (grooming)
*	Sprint review (demos)
*	Sprint retrospectives

These ceremonies are described briefly in this section and in more detail in the upcoming chapters.
