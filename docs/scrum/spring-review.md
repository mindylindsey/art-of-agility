# Sprint Review (Sprint Demos)

During the sprint review, team members demonstrate each of the items that they have completed during the sprint for the product owner, stakeholders, 
and other team members. The product owner and stakeholders ask questions and give feedback. The team discusses how the completed items helped to 
achieve the sprint goal and discuss what items were not completed.
