# Daily Standups

The daily standup is a time for the team to gather for a quick status update. During the standup, each team member answers 3 questions:

*	What did I do yesterday?
*	What am I going to do today?
*	Do I have any blockers?

Detailed discussion about tasks should be tabled for discussion after the daily standup. Team members should stand during the daily standup to 
encourage them to be brief in their updates. The goal of the meeting is to keep everyone informed about the work being performed by others on the 
team as well as to address any issues that are preventing work from being completed.
