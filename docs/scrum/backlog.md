# Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog

The _product backlog_ is the list of items needed to develop the product. These items include feature enhancements, bug fixes, etc. and are prioritized 
by the product owner.

The _sprint backlog_ is the subset of the product backlog that the scrum team plans to complete during a given sprint. The team identifies which items will be 
handled during the sprint during the sprint planning meeting at the start of the sprint.
