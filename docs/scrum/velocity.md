# Velocity
Velocity is an average amount of work (measured in story points) that the scrum team completes each sprint. Only the points for fully completed user stories 
counts towards the teamâ€™s velocity. 

There is no ideal velocity that all teams should strive to achieve, as story points are just a relative measure of size. Established teams should ensure 
that they maintain or continue to improve their velocity (whatever that is) and rather than trying to achieve a particular velocity.
