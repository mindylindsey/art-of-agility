# Sprint Retrospective

Facilitated by the scrum master, the sprint retrospective is a forum to discuss lessons learned from the newly completed sprint. The team focuses 
on the things that went right (and that should be continued) as well as ways to improve the things that did not go well (and how to correct). 
The team looks for ways to facilitate working together and being productive.
