# Backlog Refinement (Backlog Grooming)

Backlog refinement (previously known as backlog grooming) is the process of reviewing the items in the product backlog. During backlog refinement, 
the product owner and scrum team:

*	Review the priority of the items in the product backlog to ensure that the highest priority items are at the top.
*	Split user stories into smaller stories, if they are not granular enough to be properly estimated or to be worked in a single sprint.
*	Make user stories for new product requirements, product enhancements, or technical debt that are not currently in the backlog.
*	Remove user stories that are no longer needed.

The team can discuss any of the items in the product backlog but should focus on refining the highest priority items, so that the team has a good 
understanding of those items to be worked in the upcoming sprints.
