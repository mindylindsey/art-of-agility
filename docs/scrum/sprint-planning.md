# Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is the process of determining which product backlog items will be worked on (and completed) during in the sprint. The product owner 
and developers work together to decide which items to include in the sprint, although most of the items will be taken from the top of the prioritized 
product backlog. During sprint planning the team agrees upon the size (number of story points) for each item included in the sprint. If there is 
disagreement on the sizes of the stories, the team discusses until consensus is reached. The scrum master facilitates the discussion. Stories might 
need to be broken down further before they can be sized. Teams can expect to spend an hour to two hours for each week of the sprint in planning. 
So, for a two-week sprint, team could spend 2 to 4 hours in sprint planning. Sprint planning generally takes place on the first day of a new sprint.
