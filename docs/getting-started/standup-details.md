Each team members indicates what they did the day before, what they are going to do today, and if they have any issues blocking their progress. 
The daily standup brings visibility into the work performed by each team member and helps to identify:

*	Issues blocking the work, so that those issues can be resolved quickly
*	The amount of work completed and remaining for the sprint

The scrum master leads the daily standup and should keep the team focused on the high-level status. Detailed design discussions and questions should 
be tabled for discussion after the standup. If team members start going into too much detail or others start asking design-related questions, the 
scrum master should remind them to focus on their status update and to put additional items into a parking lot. The individuals that need to be included 
in the parking lot discussions can remain after standup or schedule another time to discuss.

If team members are not progressing through their tasks but are not reporting any blockers, they should be held accountable by the scrum master and other 
team members.
