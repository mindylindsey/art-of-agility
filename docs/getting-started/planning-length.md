# How Long Does Planning Take?
Sprint planning takes approximately 1 to 2 hours to complete for every week of the sprint. So, for a two-week sprint, planning should take 2 to 4 hours. 
The duration may vary depending on the experience of your team and how well you have groomed your backlog. Highly functioning Scrum teams may be able to 
complete planning in almost half of the time. Planning may take longer if your team needs to spend time developing a better understanding of backlog items 
before they can assign story points and/or you have stories that you must split so that they are small enough to be completed within the sprint.
