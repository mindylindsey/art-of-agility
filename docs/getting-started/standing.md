Do you actually have to standup in the meeting? Truthfully, no. However, standing up does help to keep the team focused and keep the updates short. 
If you are standing up in a conference room, you are more likely to pay attention and less likely to be on your computer doing other work or answering 
emails. You are also less likely to spend too much on your status update, especially as you watch.

If you choose to allow your team to sit down during the daily standup, you might want to enforce other rules like no phones or other electronic 
devices in the room, unless you are using your computer to display an electronic sprint board.
