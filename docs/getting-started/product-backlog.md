# Creating a Product Backlog

The product backlog is the prioritized list of feature enhancements or fixes for your product or service. The items that need to be delivered first 
appear at the top of the product backlog. The product owner and the development team collaborate review the items in the backlog. 

Large team initiatives are represented in your backlog as epics. Those epics will be broken down into several user stories. Each user story contains one or 
more tasks. Although your group may have multiple initiatives, there is just one product backlog. Users stories for each of the initiatives that you support are prioritized into a single list.
For example, letâ€™s say that your team is building a call center software program. The big initiatives in this project are 1) creating the call center 
operator user interface 2) creating a database to store recordings and 3) creating a reporting tool for operator analytics.
