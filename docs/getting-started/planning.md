# Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is the process of determining which product backlog items can be completed during the sprint. The team discusses each of the potential 
work items for the upcoming sprint. Unless a new priority item has come up just before spring planning that as not been groomed, the team should be 
familiar with the work item, and discussion can begin with a brief refresher of the details of the story. New priority items may require a more detailed 
discussion.

Make sure to consider any of the lessons learned from the previous sprint retrospective as you begin planning the new sprint. Whether those lessons 
learned are related to mistakes made in sizing tasks or to how the team can work more efficiently, they should be top of mind as your plan your upcoming sprint.

## Who Attends?

The entire scrum team attends sprint planning, including the product owner, scrum master, and development team. The product owner provides information 
on the highest priority backlog items that should be considered as potential work items for the sprint and proposes the sprint goal.

With the product owner, the team discusses the amount of work that can be completed during the sprint. The scrum master facilitates the discussion of the 
work items. The amount of work that can be completed depends on the complexity of the items, the team’s velocity, and the team members’ availability. 

If a team member is not available for sprint planning (due to illness, vacation, etc.), you should continue with sprint planning at the regularly scheduled time. 
The rest of the team should have enough information about the user stories and the team’s velocity to determine how many of the priority items can be 
completed in the sprint. Even if the product owner is not available, the team should have enough information from backlog grooming sessions to be able to 
plan the sprint. Absent team members can provide feedback upon their return, if they feel that mistakes were made in scoping projects.
