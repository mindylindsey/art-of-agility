# Retrospectives

During the sprint retrospective, the teams reflect on their processes and evaluate the way that they work. This introspection occurs at the end of 
the sprint so that the team can implement any improvements in the next sprint.

## Who Attends?
All members of the development team, the scrum master, and the product owner attend the retrospective.

## When Does It Occur
The retrospective occurs on the last day of the sprint just after the sprint review.
