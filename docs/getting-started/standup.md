# Conducting Daily Standups

The daily standup (sometimes referred to as the daily scrum) provides the team a forum to meet to provide a status update, including the work 
plan of each team member for the upcoming day.

## Who Attends?

The scrum master and development team are required to attend the daily standup, as the meeting is intended to keep the team informed of each otherâ€™s 
status. However, the product owner and other attendees are welcome to attend, as long as they understand that they are just observers and are not to 
participate in the discussion.
