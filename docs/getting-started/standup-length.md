# How Long Do Daily Standups Last?

The Scrum Guide states that the daily standup is a “15-minute time-boxed event.” However, you daily standup may vary in length, depending 
on the size of your team. Updates should take no longer than a couple of minutes per individual.

If you are having problems with the team not keeping their updates short enough, you can set a timer for one or two minutes. Team members, then, 
have to keep their updates to that duration.
