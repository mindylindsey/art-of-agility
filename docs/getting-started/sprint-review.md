# Sprint Review

The sprint review gives the team the opportunity to inspect the work produced in the sprint and discuss the direction of the product, based on its 
current state. This ceremony is often referred to as a sprint demo, as it provides team members the opportunity to demonstrate their work. 
However, the sprint review is designed to consider elements of the product beyond simply what was produced in the sprint. This is a time for 
stakeholders to get a clear view of the product and to provide feedback.

## Who Attends?
The product owner, stakeholders, scrum master, and development team attend the sprint review.

## When Does it Occur?
The sprint review occurs on the last day of the sprint just before the sprint retrospective.
