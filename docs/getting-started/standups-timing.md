# When Do Standups Take Place?

As the name implies, daily standups should occur every day of the sprint—typically the beginning of the day. To ensure maximum attendance for the 
meeting, you should consider scheduling this meeting at the same time every day during a time period when the team is available and focused on the 
day ahead. That is to say, there is no rule against scheduling the daily scrum 30 minutes or an hour after the start of your company’s workday to give 
developers time to get settled, check email, and/or catch up on issues from the day before. Scheduling the meeting a little later in the morning also 
reduces the chances that heavy traffic is going to prevents team members from showing up (or showing up on time.)
