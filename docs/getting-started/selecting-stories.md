# How Do You Pick Items for the Sprint?

The items for the sprint are selected from the list of product backlog items that have been prioritized by the product owner and that apply to the 
sprint goal. During sprint planning the team works with the product owner to determine how much work can be done. Although items for the sprint are 
generally taken from the top of the product backlog, lower priority items can be pulled into the sprint as a result of negotiations between the product 
owner and development team.

The team should select only those items that they believe can be completed within the sprint cycle based on the team’s capacity. Things to consider 
when consider the team’s capacity include:

*	Who is available to work this sprint? 
*	Do team members have vacations during some or all of the sprint? 
*	Are there company holidays that fall during the sprint that effectively reduce the number of workdays in the sprint?
