# When Do You Plan the Sprint?

Generally, spring planning occurs on the first day of the sprint. You will want to have a regularly scheduled time and place for the meeting to 
ensure that the team can attend. Some teams choose to start their sprints first thing on Monday morning on the first day of the sprint. That seems 
reasonable, as that gives your team the maximum amount of time to work on your tasks. However, if you allow you team some amount of flexibility in their 
arrival time or simply have issues with individuals being about to focus first thing on a Monday morning, you certainly can schedule your sprint planning 
meeting for a little later in the morning and allow you team to get ready to talk about tasks after they have had a chance to catch up on emails and have 
a cup of coffee (or two).
