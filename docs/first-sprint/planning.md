# Planning Your First Sprint

If you are just getting started with Agile development, you might be still be trying to understand how to understand how to break up tasks into small enough chunks that they can be completed in 2-3 weeks.

Transitioning to Agile requires a fundamental shift in how you do work, and that includes the work that you do to maintain your team. This may seem like a herculean task. If so, remember, the goal is not to “start doing Agile” perfectly in your first sprint or even in the next 20 sprints. The goal is to adapt an Agile mindset in the way you approach the work and your team. Embrace the change.

This is a work in progress.
