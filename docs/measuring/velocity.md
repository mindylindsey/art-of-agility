# Velocity

Knowing the amount of work that the team can complete within each sprint enables the product owner to plan the delivery of future releases. A new 
scrum team’s velocity may be volatile, as they get accustomed to working in a new structure. Over time, the team’s velocity should increase, until 
the team is established. Once established, the team’s velocity should be fairly stable. The amount of work that they can complete should be predictable. 
Decreases in velocity should be evaluated to determine whether process changes are needed to reestablish team performance.

Velocity cannot be used to compare the performance of two different scrum teams. Each team has its own view of how to assign story points to a given 
story. The criteria that a team uses should be consistent within the team but may not be comparable to the criteria used by another team.
