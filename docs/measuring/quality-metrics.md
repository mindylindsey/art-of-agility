# Quality Metrics

Completing large numbers of features and getting them to market quickly is meaningless unless you are also monitoring the quality of your products. Customers demand reliable products, and you must be able to deliver if you hope to retain your customers.

Code coverage through automated testing and defects are two ways to measure the quality of your software product. They are leading indicators of software quality. You will need to do some analysis of the data you collect with respect to these metrics, but evaluating these metrics on a regular basis will help you to determine the overall health of your product.

Continue with this section to learn more about how to use code coverage and defect tracking as a way to measue performance.
