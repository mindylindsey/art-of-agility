# Completion Metrics

This section describes several ways of measuring the speed in which the scrum team is delivering product. Velocity is a key metric used to 
measure how much work a team completes work. This measurement is used as the basis for burn down and burn up charts that show the amount of work 
being completed. Measures of how quickly the team can produce work can also be evaluated by lead and cycle times, also described in this section.
