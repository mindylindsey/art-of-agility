# Completion Metrics

Completion metrics help you to measure the amount of work completed each sprint. By measuring the amount of work in this way, you can begin to determine how quickly you are able to deliver features to your customers.

The key metric used to measure how much work a team completes work is the team's velocity. This measurement is used as the basis for burn down and burn up charts that show the amount of work being completed. 

Lead and cycle times measure how quickly the team can produce work from the time that a feature is requested until it is delivered as well as how quickly the team produces work once they begin working on it during a given sprint.

Each of these metrics is described in more detail in this section.
