# Code Coverage

Code coverage indicates the percentage of code tested by automated tests. Code coverage measures the amount of code that is tested but does not 
indicate the quality of the tests. Therefore, code coverage alone cannot be used as a quality metric. However, increases in the amount of code coverage 
combined with defect detection metrics can measure the quality of your tests and the quality of your code.
