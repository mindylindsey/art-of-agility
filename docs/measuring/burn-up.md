# Burn Up

Rather than showing the amount of work remaining in a project, a burn up chart shows the amount of work completed. To illustrate this, the burn up 
chart climbs as work gets completed, while the burn down chart that declines.

A reference line at the top of the burn up chart shows the scope of work for the project. The reference line indicates when work is added or removed 
from the scope of the release. 

The following is an example of a burn up chart.
